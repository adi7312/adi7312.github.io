I'm student of Cybersecurity at Warsaw University of Technology with commercial experience in the area of penetration testing. In context of security I'm interested in penetration tests, malware analysis and reverse engineering. In my spare time, I expand my knowledge in the area of operating systems and computer architecture.

Skillset:
* Security  
* Linux
* C++
* Python
* Java

From time to time I upload writeups to some CTF tasks (web, pwn, re and much more).
